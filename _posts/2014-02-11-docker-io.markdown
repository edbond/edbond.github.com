[Docker][docker] is a lightweight alternative to virtual machines
like [VirtualBox][virtualbox].
It uses linux containers (lxc) and cgroups to separate vm instances
(called *containers* in docker). That is a recent Linux features which
makes kernel *3.8* a minimum requirement. Containers have their own
file system, network interfaces, processes. You can expose container
ports outside
of container and link containers together.

Images in docker can be build from other images, and containers is a
snapshots of the image. This allows you to quickly run several
identical images. Containers can be stored after modification, new
state will be saved as a diff from original container image.

Although you can log in container and install everything using
console it is advised to write a script to generate container -
**Dockerfile**. Docker uses caching and creates a new image after
each successful step, next run is much faster because such steps are
skipped and last existing image is used. *docker build* command is
used to create an image from Dockerfile.

Docker is not production-ready yet, they target 1.0 somewhere in April
 2014. Current version of docker is 0.8. Docker is not running on
 Windows, MacOS support is very limited.
There is an [index site][index] for sharing public images and a server
for hosting [private repositories][private].

Containers running a single process (web server, memcached) using CMD
instruction. Container stops when process stopped.
It is possible to use [supervisor][supervisor] to run several processes in one container.

Here is my current Dockerfile for installing ruby 1.9.3 and gems specified
in Gemfile.
